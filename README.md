# DataStructures-From-Scratch

This project is a personal learning exercise where I implement data structures from scratch in C# to better understand how they work internally.

## Structure

- The solution contains multiple projects.
- Each project focuses on a single data structure.
- The goal is to explore the logic, behavior, and inner workings of each data structure by building them manually.

## How to Run

1. Open the solution (`DataStructures-From-Scratch.sln`) in Visual Studio.
2. In the **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project you want to run.
3. Select **Set as Startup Project**.
4. Press `F5` or click **Start** to run the selected project.
